# Walmart Data Analysis: SQL + Python Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data cleaning, transformation, and loading.
- **SQL**: Data querying and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Organizing Python scripts and performing ETL.
- **MySQL**: Storing and analyzing data.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and project hosting.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. ETL Process (Python)

- **Extract**: Data was collected from various sources using Kaggle API.
- **Transform**: Data cleaning, formatting, and transformation were performed to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Load**: The processed data was loaded into a MySQL database for further analysis.

### 2. EDA Process (SQL)

- Analyzing payment methods and transaction counts.
- Counting the total number of unique branches.
- Finding the maximum quantity sold.
- Identifying the highest-rated category in each branch.
- Finding the busiest day for each branch.
- Calculating the total profit by category.
- Analyzing revenue decrease between 2022 and 2023.
- Identifying the most preferred payment methods.

## 💡 Insights and Findings

- The analysis identified the busiest branches and most profitable categories.
- Revenue decline trends between 2022 and 2023 were highlighted.
- Payment methods with the highest transaction volumes were identified.
